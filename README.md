International currencies for DeFi

We introduce a new protocol for creating synthetic international currencies in decentralised finance. The system use what we call a currency factory for each currency. Each factory is independent from each other and cloned from a security-audited smart contract (Liquity).

8 currency factory at start: $tEUR ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º, $tCNY ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³, $tCHF ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­, $tAUD ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º, $tCAD ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦, $tJPY ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ, $tKRW ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· and $tGBP ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 
with price oracles from ChainLink.

# Dividend tokens
Each currency factory is emitting its own token, which allow holders to get a share of the factory revenues by staking them in the Dividend Pool. 

8 dividend tokens $EURdiv, $CNYdiv, $CHFdiv, $AUDdiv, $CADdiv, $JPYdiv, $KRWdiv and $GBPdiv.

# Governance token
A governance token $XEROF is introduced to govern the addition and promotion of new currencies in the protocol and general integration in the DeFi eco-system.
