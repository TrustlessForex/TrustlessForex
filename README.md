International currencies for DeFi

We introduce a new protocol for creating synthetic international currencies in decentralised finance. The system use what we call a currency factory for each currency. Each factory is independent from each other and cloned from a security-audited smart contract (Liquity).

Currency factory at start: TEUR ğŸ‡ªğŸ‡º, TCNY ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡³, TCHF ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡­, TAUD ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡º, TCAD ğŸ‡¨ğŸ‡¦, TJPY ğŸ‡¯ğŸ‡µ, TKRW ğŸ‡°ğŸ‡· and TGBP ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ 
with price oracles from ChainLink.

# Dividend tokens
Each currency factory is emitting its own token, which allow holders to get a share of the factory revenues by staking them in the Dividend Pool. 

8 dividend tokens EURDIV, CNYDIV, CHFDIV, AUDDIV, CADDIV, JPYDIV, KRWDIV and GBPDVD.

# Governance token
A governance token $XEROF is introduced to govern the addition and promotion of new currencies in the protocol and general integration in the DeFi eco-system.
